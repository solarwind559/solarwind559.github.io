    &ensp; &ensp; In 2011, Jungkook auditioned for the South Korean talent show Superstar K during its auditions in Daegu. Though 
    he was not selected, he received casting offers from seven entertainment companies. He eventually chose to become a trainee 
    under Big Hit Entertainment after seeing RM, now his fellow band member and leader in BTS, perform. To work on his dance 
    skills in preparation for debut, he went to Los Angeles during the summer of 2012 to receive dance training from Movement 
    Lifestyle. In June 2012, he appeared in Jo Kwon's "I'm Da One" music video and also worked as a backup dancer for 
    Glam before his debut. He graduated from Seoul's School of Performing Arts, an arts high school, in 2017.
    On June 12, 2013, Jungkook made his debut as a member of BTS with the release of the single 2 Cool 4 Skool.

    placed first for 10 weeks in a row for magazine Hi China, under the most beloved celebrities list in China. Jungkook is 
    also extremely popular on social media amongst fans. In October 2018, he broke the record of most real-time viewers with 
    his solo live broadcast in V Live history, with more than 3.7 million viewers worldwide;[38] in December 2018, a video 
    of him singing in the studio became the most retweeted tweet in South Korea that year. Various artists have cited him as 
    an influence and role model. <br><br>
