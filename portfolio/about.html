    <h1>Artist turned into a programmer</h1>
    <p>It somehow happened this way. Went to an artschool. Did traditional art. Did digital art. Saw a coding school advert. Suddenly wanted to code.</p>
    <p>Now it's been some time since I wrote my first code outputting "Hello World" on November 2020, and I'm still coding.</p>
    <p>I have finished the <a href="https://rigacoding.lv/">Riga Coding School's</a>  WEB development course and afterwards moved on to finish a 3-month internship at <a href="https://piere.lv/">piere.lv</a>.</p>
    <p>Doing some little test projects from time to time. Slowly but surely I keep learning more in the world of Web Development.</p>
    <p>My name is Sandy, I love to learn and create things.</p>
