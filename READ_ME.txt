IN CASE OF A BLANK PAGE,
WHEN TRYING TO LOG IN AS AN ADMINISTRATOR:

GO TO YOUR FTP software where you have your server files put up.
FIND the path: htdocs/wp-content/ and temporarily rename the folder called "plugins". (For example, change it to "plugins1")
REFRESH your admin login page and you should be able to log in. 
CHANGE BACK the folder you renamed into "plugins".


However, this should not happen unless there has been some editing done in the theme or plugins files.
